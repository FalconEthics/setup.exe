## setup.exe
 ~My coding environment setup

I made it so that i can have a backup of my coding environment, with this i can almost setup any new device of mine without needing to remember any of my productivity softwares and tools!
It's a very straightforward app, i have written in java, it simply scans the files and updates the list which i update on a reqular basis and prints the steps that are required respectively.
